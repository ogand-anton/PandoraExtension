I am a big fan of Pandora. And yes, I am *always* listening...

I always have Pandora running. So the periodic messsages of whether I am or am not "still listening" became a nuissance. To combat this, I used to open dev tools every time I navigated to Pandora, and I would launch a small script that was remembered in my console history. This script was just a tiny callback being called every few seconds to click the "I am still listening" button if it was every present. Opening dev tools on every visit to Pandora also became very tedious...

So, I decided to expand the small script into a Chrome extension. 

After that, I just kept adding functionality:
* dedicated ad blocker to block ads, Google Analytics requests, tracking data and statistics, and anything else I did not like
* automatically reloading the app if for some reason other than a manual pause it stops playing music
